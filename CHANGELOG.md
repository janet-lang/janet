  user more easily import modules from many directories.
- Add `nth` and `only-tags` PEG specials to select from sub-captures while
  dropping the rest.

## 1.36.0 - 2024-09-07

- Add `:only` argument to `import` to allow for easier control over imported bindings.
- Add extra optional `env` argument to `eval` and `eval-string`.
- Allow naming function literals with a keyword. This allows better stacktraces for macros without
  accidentally adding new bindings.
- Add `bundle/` module for managing packages within Janet. This should replace the jpm packaging
  format eventually and is much simpler and amenable to more complicated builds.

- Support the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to turn off VT100 color codes in repl (and in scripts).
  See http://no-color.org/
- Disallow using `(splice x)` in contexts where it doesn't make sense rather than silently coercing to `x`.

- Add `ffi/pointer-buffer` to convert pointers to buffers the cannot be reallocated. This
  allows easier manipulation of FFI memory, memory mapped files, and buffer memory shared between threads.
- Calling `ev/cancel` on a fiber waiting on `ev/gather` will correctly
  cancel the child fibers.
- Add `(sandbox ...)` function to core for permission based security. Also add `janet_sandbox` to C API.
  The sandbox allows limiting access to the file system, network, ffi, and OS resources at runtime.
- Add `(.locals)` function to debugger to see currently bound local symbols.
- Track symbol -> slot mapping so debugger can get symbolic information. This exposes local bindings
  in `debug/stack` and `disasm`.
- Add `os/compiler` to detect what host compiler was used to compile the interpreter
- Add support for mingw and cygwin builds (mingw support also added in jpm).

## 1.26.0 - 2023-01-07
- Add `ffi/malloc` and `ffi/free`. Useful as tools of last resort.
- Add `ffi/jitfn` to allow calling function pointers generated at runtime from machine code.
  Bring your own assembler, though.
- Channels can now be marshalled. Pending state is not saved, only items in the channel.
- Use the new `.length` function pointer on abstract types for lengths. Adding
  a `length` method will still work as well.
- Support byte views on abstract types with the `.bytes` function pointer.
- Add the `u` format specifier to printf family functions.
- Allow printing 64 integer types in `printf` and `string/format` family functions.
- Allow importing modules from custom directories more easily with the `@` prefix
  to module paths. For example, if there is a dynamic binding :custom-modules that
  is a file system path to a directory of modules, import from that directory with
  `(import @custom-modules/mymod)`.
- Fix error message bug in FFI library.

## 1.25.1 - 2022-10-29
- Add `memcmp` function to core library.

- Allow setting `(dyn :task-id)` in fibers to improve context in supervisor messages. Prior to
  this change, supervisor messages over threaded channels would be from ambiguous threads/fibers.

## 1.23.0 - 2022-06-20
- Add experimental `ffi/` module for interfacing with dynamic libraries and raw function pointers. Only available
  on 64 bit linux, mac, and bsd systems.
- Allow using `&named` in function prototypes for named arguments. This is a more ergonomic
  variant of `&keys` that isn't as redundant, more self documenting, and allows extension to
  things like default arguments.
- Add `delay` macro for lazy evaluate-and-save thunks.
- Remove pthread.h from janet.h for easier includes.
- Add `debugger` - an easy to use debugger function that just takes a fiber.

## 1.21.2 - 2022-04-01
- C functions `janet_dobytes` and `janet_dostring` will now enter the event loop if it is enabled.
- Fix hashing regression - hash of negative 0 must be the same as positive 0 since they are equal.
- The `flycheck` function no longer pollutes the module/cache
- Fix quasiquote bug in compiler
- Disallow use of `cancel` and `resume` on fibers scheduled or created with `ev/go`, as well as the root
  fiber.

## 1.20.0 - 2022-1-27
- Add `:missing-symbol` hook to `compile` that will act as a catch-all macro for undefined symbols.

  scan-number function without immediate string creation.

## 1.17.2 - 2021-09-18
- Remove include of windows.h from janet.h. This caused issues on certain projects.
- Fix formatting in doc-format to better handle special characters in signatures.
- Fix some marshalling bugs.

- Allow passing a closure directly to `ev/go` to spawn fibers on the event loop.

## 1.17.1 - 2021-08-29
- Fix docstring typos
- Add `make install-jpm-git` to make jpm co-install simpler if using the Makefile.

## 1.17.0 - 2021-08-21
- Add the `-E` flag for one-liners with the `short-fn` syntax for argument passing.
- Add support for threaded abstract types. Threaded abstract types can easily be shared between threads.
- Deprecate the `thread` library. Use threaded channels and ev instead.
- Channels can now be marshalled.
- Add the ability to close channels with `ev/chan-close` (or `:close`).

saving and restoring the entire VM state.

## 1.16.1 - 2021-06-09
- Add `maclintf` - a utility for adding linting messages when inside macros.
- Print source code of offending line on compiler warnings and errors.
- Fix some issues with linting and re-add missing `make docs`.
- Allow controlling linting with dynamic bindings `:lint-warn`, `:lint-error`, and `:lint-levels`.
- Add `-w` and `-x` command line flags to the `janet` binary to set linting thresholds.
  linting thresholds are as follows:
    - :none - will never be trigger.
    - :relaxed - will only trigger on `:relaxed` lints.
    - :normal - will trigger on `:relaxed` and `:normal` lints.
    - :strict - will trigger on `:strict`, `:normal`, and `:relaxed` lints. This will catch the most issues
      but can be distracting.

## 1.16.0 - 2021-05-30
- Add color documentation to the `doc` macro - enable/disable with `(dyn :doc-color)`.
- Remove simpler HTML docs from distribution - use website or built-in documentation instead.

  that can be installed via `jpm`.
- Add `from-pairs` to core.
- Add `JPM_OS_WHICH` environment variable to jpm to allow changing auto-detection behavior.
- The flychecker will consider any top-level calls of functions that start with `define-` to
  be safe to execute and execute them. This allows certain patterns (like spork/path) to be
  better processed by the flychecker.

## 1.15.5 - 2021-04-25
- Add `declare-headers` to jpm.
- Fix error using unix pipes on BSDs.

- Add optional argument to `parser/produce`.
- Add `no-core` option to creating standalone binaries to make execution faster.
- Fix bug where a buffer overflow could be confused with an out of memory error.
- Change error output to `file:line:column: message`. Column is in bytes - tabs
  are considered to have width 1 (instead of 8).

## 1.14.2 - 2021-01-23
- Allow `JANET_PROFILE` env variable to load a profile before loading the repl.
- Update `tracev` macro to allow `def` and `var` inside to work as expected.
- Use `(dyn :peg-grammar)` for passing a default grammar to `peg/compile` instead of loading
  `default-peg-grammar` directly from the root environment.
- Add `ev/thread` for combining threading with the event loop.
- Add `ev/do-thread` to make `ev/thread` easier to use.
- Automatically set supervisor channel in `net/accept-loop` and `net/server` correctly.

## 1.14.1 - 2021-01-18
- Add `doc-of` for reverse documentation lookup.
- Add `ev/give-supervsior` to send a message to the supervising channel.
- Add `ev/gather` and `chan` argument to `ev/go`. This new argument allows "supervisor channels"
  for fibers to enable structured concurrency.
- Make `-k` flag work on stdin if no files are given.
- Add `flycheck` function to core.
- Make `backmatch` and `backref` more expressive in pegs.
- Fix buggy `string/split`.
- Add `fiber/last-value` to get the value that was last yielded, errored, or signaled
  by a fiber.
- Remove `:generate` verb from `loop` macros. Instead, use the `:in` verb
  which will now work on fibers as well as other data structures.
- Define `next`, `get`, and `in` for fibers. This lets
  `each`, `map`, and similar iteration macros can now iterate over fibers.
- Remove macro `eachy`, which can be replaced by `each`.
- Add `dflt` argument to find-index.
- Deprecate `file/popen` in favor of `os/spawn`.
- Add `:all` keyword to `ev/read` and `net/read` to make them more like `file/read`. However, we
  do not provide any `:line` option as that requires buffering.
- Change repl behavior to make Ctrl-C raise SIGINT on posix. The old behavior for Ctrl-C,
  to clear the current line buffer, has been moved to Ctrl-Q.
- Importing modules that start with `/` is now the only way to import from project root.
  Before, this would import from / on disk. Previous imports that did not start with `.` or `/`
  are now unambiguously importing from the syspath, instead of checking both the syspath and
  the project root. This is backwards incompatible and dependencies should be updated for this.
- Change hash function for numbers.
- Improve error handling of `dofile`.
- Bug fixes in networking and subprocess code.
- Use markdown formatting in more places for docstrings.

## 1.13.1 - 2020-12-13
- Pretty printing a table with a prototype will look for `:_name` instead of `:name`
  in the prototype table to tag the output.
- `match` macro implementation changed to be tail recursive.
- Adds a :preload loader which allows one to manually put things into `module/cache`.
- Add `buffer/push` function.
- Backtick delimited strings and buffers are now reindented based on the column of the
  opening delimiter. Whitespace in columns to the left of the starting column is ignored unless
  there are non-space/non-newline characters in that region, in which case the old behavior is preserved.
- Argument to `(error)` combinator in PEGs is now optional.
- Add `(line)` and `(column)` combinators to PEGs to capture source line and column.
  This should make error reporting a bit easier.
- Add `merge-module` to core.
- During installation and release, merge janetconf.h into janet.h for easier install.
- Add `upscope` special form.
- `os/execute` and `os/spawn` can take streams for redirecting IO.
- Add `:parser` and `:read` parameters to `run-context`.
- Add `os/open` if ev is enabled.
- Add `os/pipe` if ev is enabled.
- Add `janet_thread_current(void)` to C API
- Add integer parsing forms to pegs. This makes parsing many binary protocols easier.
- Lots of updates to networking code - now can use epoll (or poll) on linux and IOCP on windows.
- Add `ev/` module. This exposes a fiber scheduler, queues, timeouts, and other functionality to users
  for single threaded cooperative scheduling and asynchronous IO.
- Add `net/accept-loop` and `net/listen`. These functions break down `net/server` into it's essential parts
  and are more flexible. They also allow further improvements to these utility functions.
- Various small bug fixes.

## 1.12.2 - 2020-09-20
- Add janet\_try and janet\_restore to C API.
- Fix `os/execute` regression on windows.

- Expose `janet_cfuns_prefix` in C API.
- Add `os/proc-wait` and `os/proc-kill` for interacting with processes.
- Add `janet_getjfile` to C API.
- Allow redirection of stdin, stdout, and stderr by passing keywords in the env table in `os/spawn` and `os/execute`.
- Add `os/spawn` to get a core/process back instead of an exit code as in `os/execute`.
  When called like this, `os/execute` returns immediately.
- Add `:x` flag to os/execute to raise error when exit code is non-zero.
- Don't run `main` when flychecking.
- Add `:n` flag to `file/open` to raise an error if file cannot be opened.
- Fix import macro to not try and coerce everything to a string.

- Add a number of new math functions.
- Improve debugger experience and capabilities. See examples/debugger.janet
  for what an interactive debugger could look like.
- Add `debug/step` (janet\_step in the C API) for single stepping Janet bytecode.
- The built in repl now can enter the debugger on any signal (errors, yields,
  user signals, and debug signals). To enable this, type (setdyn :debug true)
  in the repl environment.
- When exiting the debugger, the fiber being debugged is resumed with the exit value
  of the debug session (the value returned by `(quit return-value)`, or nil if user typed Ctrl-D).
- `(quit)` can take an optional argument that is the return value. If a module
  contains `(quit some-value)`, the value of that module returned to `(require "somemod")`
  is the return value. This lets module writers completely customize a module without writing
  a loader.
- Add nested quasiquotation.
- Add `os/cryptorand`
- Add `prinf` and `eprinf` to be have like `printf` and `eprintf`. The latter two functions

- Add `--test` flag to jpm to test libraries on installation.
- Add `math/rng`, `math/rng-int`, and `math/rng-uniform`.
- Add `in` function to index in a stricter manner. Conversely, `get` will
  now not throw errors on bad keys.
- Indexed types and byte sequences will now error when indexed out of range or
  with bad keys.
- Add rng functions to Janet. This also replaces the RNG behind `math/random`
  and `math/seedrandom` with a consistent, platform independent RNG.

- Add the `quickbin` command to jpm.
- Create shell.c when making the amalgamated source. This can be compiled with
  janet.c to make the janet interpreter.
- Add `cli-main` function to the core, which invokes Janet's CLI interface.
  This basically moves what was init.janet into boot.janet.
- Improve flychecking, and fix flychecking bugs introduced in 1.4.0.
- Add `prin`, `eprint`, `eprintf` and `eprin` functions. The
  functions prefix with e print to `(dyn :err stderr)`
- Print family of functions can now also print to buffers
  (before, they could only print to files.) Output can also
  be completely disabled with `(setdyn :out false)`.
- `printf` is now a c function for optimizations in the case
  of printing to buffers.

## 1.4.0 - 2019-10-14
- Add `quit` function to exit from a repl, but not always exit the entire
  application.
- Add `update-pkgs` to jpm.
- Integrate jpm with https://github.com/janet-lang/pkgs.git. jpm can now
  install packages based on their short names in the package listing, which
  can be customized via an env variable.
- Add `varfn` macro
- Add compile time arity checking when function in function call is known.
- Added `slice` to the core library.
- The `*/slice` family of functions now can take nil as start or end to get
  the same behavior as the defaults (0 and -1) for those parameters.
- `string/` functions that take a pattern to search for will throw an error
  when receiving the empty string.
- Replace (start:end) style stacktrace source position information with
  line, column. This should be more readable for humans. Also, range information
  can be recovered by re-parsing source.

- Fix some linking issues when creating executables with native dependencies.
- jpm now runs each test script in a new interpreter.

- Add `mean` to core.
- Abstract types that implement the `:+`, `:-`, `:*`, `:/`, `:>`, `:==`, `:<`,
  `:<=`, and `:>=` methods will work with the corresponding built-in
  arithmetic functions. This means built-in integer types can now be used as
  normal number values in many contexts.
- Allow (length x) on typed arrays an other abstract types that implement
  the :length method.

## 1.3.0 - 2019-09-05
- Add `get-in`, `put-in`, `update-in`, and `freeze` to core.
- Add `jpm run rule` and `jpm rules` to jpm to improve utility and discoverability of jpm.

  The functionality in `cook` is now bundled directly in the `jpm` script.
- Add `buffer/format` and `string/format` format flags `Q` and `q` to print colored and
  non-colored single-line values, similar to `P` and `p`.
- Change default repl to print long sequences on one line and color stacktraces if color is enabled.
- Add `backmatch` pattern for PEGs.

## 1.2.0 - 2019-08-08
- Add `take` and `drop` functions that are easier to use compared to the
  existing slice functions.

- Add `(dyn :executable)` at top level to get what used to be
  `(process/args 0)`.
- Add `:linux` to platforms returned by `(os/which)`.
- Update jpm to build standalone executables. Use `declare-executable` for this.
- Add `use` macro.
- Remove `process/args` in favor of `(dyn :args)`.
- Fix bug with Nanbox implementation allowing users to created
  custom values of any type with typed array and marshal modules, which
  was unsafe.
- Add `janet_wrap_number_safe` to API, for converting numbers to Janets
  where the number could be any 64 bit, user provided bit pattern. Certain
  NaN values (which a machine will never generate as a result of a floating
  point operation) are guarded against and converted to a default NaN value.

## 1.1.0 - 2019-07-08
- Change semantics of `-l` flag to be import rather than dofile.
- Fix compiler regression in top level defs with destructuring.
- Add `table/clone`.

- Add `propagate` function so we can "rethrow" signals after they are
  intercepted. This makes signals even more flexible.
- Add `JANET_NO_DOCSTRINGS` and `JANET_NO_SOURCEMAPS` defines in janetconf.h
  for shrinking binary size.
  This seems to save about 50kB in most builds, so it's not usually worth it.
- Update module system to allow relative imports. The `:cur:` pattern
  in `module/expand-path` will expand to the directory part of the current file, or
  whatever the value of `(dyn :current-file)` is. The `:dir:` pattern gets
  the directory part of the input path name.
- Remove `:native:` pattern in `module/paths`.

- Add optional `env` argument to `all-bindings` and `all-dynamics`.
- Add scratch memory C API functions for auto-released memory on next gc.
  Scratch memory differs from normal GCed memory as it can also be freed normally
  for better performance.
